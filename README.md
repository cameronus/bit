# bit
**bit** is a tool that lets you send messages in text (called _bits_) through links, and only the first person to go to the link, unless set otherwise, will receive the text.

## Why use bit?
It's anonymous, secure, and private.
#### Anonymous
Our service does not track anything about the user. There is also no way to enter any personally identifying information.
#### Secure
Your bits are encrypted using 512-bit RSA private key encryption and all of the data is sent using SSL encryption.
#### Private
Your bit will self-destruct after someone views it (unless set otherwise), which means no one other than the person you want to can access it.

## How do I use bit?

1. Visit [our website](http://bitapp.cf/).

2. Enter your text into the large box.

3. If you want your bit to be permanent, check the box underneath the "Create" button.

4. To create it, click the "Create Bit" button beneath the text box. A window will pop up and provide you with the link to your bit.

5. Once you want someone else to see your bit: email, text, or read the bit ID to a person. Once they visit that page, the bit will be either deleted (default behavior), or it will stay there permanently (if you checked the box).
